# Intro to React

## Issues with Mod 3 Projects

React
  creating elements
  refreshing the screen / managing the DOM
    'right time'

JSX
  React ugly

Babel
  JSX is not javascript
  Transforming code into javascript

Linters
  bad code
  set of rules for writing code

Prettier Js
  reformats on save

Redux (React)
  tracking state

NPM + Webpack
  classes - didn't always make sense
  organizing code
  managing libraries - script tags, dependencies, bugs

Webpack (dev server)
  testing - save / refresh the page / test feature
  development flow

create-react-app
  configuring all this is a pain

## NPM
package manager
install different frameworks and libraries
manage the dependencies of your application

.gitignore node_modules

## Webpack
Combine files into a single script file
follow the requires / imports - actually go get that code
uses different 'loaders'

built our files into a bundle

dev-server watches for changes, fixes our broken flow

## React
ReactDOM.render - take over the DOM below this element
What can we render? React Elements!

create element is ugly


## JSX

## Babel
