# React Props

## Let's make an app!

## Thinking in React

1. Draw Boxes
2. Build static version (without actual data)
3. Decide which props components need
4. Thread the props through the app

## Thinking in Components

organize code
one component per file
start with a functional component
move to a class component when we need to

## Props

parameterize a component
destructuring assignment
