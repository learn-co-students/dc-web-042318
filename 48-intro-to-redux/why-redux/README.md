# Why Redux

![gif](http://g.recordit.co/s2OFw0VtYb.gif)

The code you clone down will have the functionality working as seen above.  

_Note that all components are defined in the same file (index.js). While this is not conventional, it will make our jobs a little easier as we begin to refactor to redux._

## Your task

Take a look at the current component structure. `App` renders a div with two children, `Header` and `Counter`.  Your goal is to make the changes described below _without altering the current structure of which components render what other components._

* Remove the code that calculates and renders the line `The current count is less than <some number>` from the `Counter` component.
* Add that same description about the current count (feel free to use the same code) **in the `Header` component in place of the text that currently says "Welcome to React"**


When lecture begins be prepared to discuss and summarize what you had to do in order to implement this change and why you had to do it.
