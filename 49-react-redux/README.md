## Problems

How do we structure the store? Does it get its own file? Reducer?

One giant reducer function
  - super messy
  - we want to separate it into smaller pieces

Component does not rerender when store state is updated
  - it would be cool if store state was a prop to our component
  - like to remove our bad hack

## react-redux

### connect

### mapStateToProps

### mapDispatchToProps

## combineReducers
