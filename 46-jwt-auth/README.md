# JWT Auth
- Explain the difference between Authentication vs. Authorization
- Authenticate via a basic controller action in Rails triggered by a fetch in React
- Store user data in state on login/signup
- Implement localStorage to store identifying information about a user in the browser (just a user ID for now)
- Automatically fetch user information based on contents of localStorage for already logged-in users
