# Recurring Moment Debugging Challenge

## Introduction

In `recurring_moment.rb` there is a broken implementation of `RecurringMoment`. There is a correct suite of RSpec tests for the class. Fix the code so that the tests pass!

## Getting Started

* `bundle install` to install the dependencies
* `rspec recurring_moment_spec.rb` to run the full suite of tests
* `rspec recurring_moment_spec.rb:[line_number]` to run a single line

Go ahead and edit the code in `recurring_moment.rb` to make the module work!

## Bonus

* What's the runtime of the `match` function?
* How could you improve this method? How could you improve the class?
